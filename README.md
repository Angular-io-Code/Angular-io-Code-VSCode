# Purpose

The purpose of the organization Angular-io-Code is to provide color theme 100% alike to the one used in and from Angular.io for all major cross platform text editors.

# Credits

The original theme is the one stored in this repository.

It was made with (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) and we appreciate the project TmTheme-Editor.

For more info visit (https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor).

RealGithub theme was not build from scratch instead we used Inspiredgithub theme (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Inspiredgithub) from (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) as a starting point, but we made some tiny changes so the resulting theme looks exaclty like the one used in and from github.

We want to thank to (https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor), the creator of (http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Inspiredgithub) and (https://github.com) beacuse they are the reason for creation of RealGithub theme.

# Mismatch

If you find any mismatch from theme used by Angular.io plase make a new Issue or new Pull Request to the original Angular-io-Code theme repository (https://github.com/Angular-io-Code/Angular-io-Code) not to this one.

# Enjoy the coding experience!

# We hope we bring you the same coding experience as browsing at (https://angular.io)!

# We <3 Angular!
